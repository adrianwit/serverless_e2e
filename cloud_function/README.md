#### Introduction


Cloud Functions is a serverless compute service that runs a specified  code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources.
The event can be fired by a specific trigger, which determines how and when your function executes.

Cloud function handler supports the following function signatures: 
 
- HTTP Endpoint
    func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)

- Other Events:
    func(context.Context, Event) (error)
